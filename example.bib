	abstract = {Molecular glues and bivalent inducers of protein degradation (also known as PROTACs) represent a fascinating new modality in pharmacotherapeutics: the potential to knockdown previously thought ‘undruggable’ targets at sub-stoichiometric concentrations in ways not possible using conventional inhibitors. Mounting evidence suggests these chemical agents, in concert with their target proteins, can be modelled as three-body binding equilibria that can exhibit significant cooperativity as a result of specific ligand-induced molecular recognition. Despite this, many existing drug design and optimization regimens still fixate on binary target engagement, in part due to limited structural data on ternary complexes. Recent crystal structures of protein complexes mediated by degrader molecules, including the first PROTAC ternary complex, underscore the importance of protein–protein interactions and intramolecular contacts to the mode of action of this class of compounds. These discoveries have opened the door to a new paradigm for structure-guided drug design: borrowing surface area and molecular recognition from nature to elicit cellular signalling.},

However, we currently lack a detailed understanding of the molecular basis for target recruitment and selectivity, which is critically required to enable rational design of degraders. Here we utilize a comprehensive characterization of the ligand-dependent CRBN–BRD4 interaction to demonstrate that binding between proteins that have not evolved to interact is plastic. Multiple X-ray crystal structures show that plasticity results in several distinct low-energy binding conformations that are selectively bound by ligands. We demonstrate that computational protein–protein docking can reveal the underlying interprotein contacts and inform the design of a BRD4 selective degrader that can discriminate between highly homologous BET bromodomains. Our findings that plastic interprotein contacts confer selectivity for ligand-induced protein dimerization provide a conceptual framework for the development of heterobifunctional ligands.},

Herein, we present a two-component peptide stapling strategy to rapidly access a variety of constrained and functionalised peptides that target the Nrf2/Keap1 PPI. The most promising peptide, P8-H containing a fatty acid tag, binds to Keap1 with nanomolar affinity and is effective at inducing transcription of ARE genes in a human lung epithelial cell line at sub-micromolar concentration. Furthermore, crystallography of the peptide in complex with Keap1 yielded a high resolution X-ray structure, adding to the toolbox of structures available to develop cell-permeable peptidomimetic inhibitors.},

In this work, we present analytical tools to easily characterize such libraries by HPLC and mass spectrometry, and in particular to simplify the isomers’ distinction requiring sequencing by MS/MS fragmentations.

In this work, we present a new computational framework to model the cooperativity between PROTAC–E3 binding and PROTAC–target binding principally through protein–protein interactions (PPIs) induced by the PROTAC. Due to the scarcity and low resolution of experimental measurements, the physical and chemical drivers of these non-native PPIs remain to be elucidated. We develop a coarse-grained (CG) approach to model interactions in the target–PROTAC–E3 complexes, which enables converged thermodynamic estimations using alchemical free energy calculation methods despite an unconventional scale of perturbations. With minimal parametrization, we successfully capture fundamental principles of cooperativity, including the optimality of intermediate PROTAC linker lengths that originates from configurational entropy. We qualitatively characterize the dependency of cooperativity on PROTAC linker lengths and protein charges and shapes. Minimal inclusion of sequence- and conformation-specific features in our current force field, however, limits quantitative modeling to reproduce experimental measurements, but further development of the CG model may allow for efficient computational screening to optimize PROTAC cooperativity.},

However, the design of synthetic PPI stabilizers remains an understudied approach. To date, there are limited examples where cooperativity has been utilized to guide the optimization of a PPI stabilizer. The 14-3-3 scaffold proteins provide an excellent platform to explore PPI stabilization because these proteins mediate several hundred PPIs, and a class of natural compounds, the fusicoccanes, are known to stabilize a subset of 14-3-3 protein interactions. 14-3-3 has been reported to negatively regulate the p65 subunit of the NF-κB transcription factor, which qualifies this protein complex as a potential target for drug discovery to control cell proliferation. Here, we report the high-resolution crystal structures of two 14-3-3 binding motifs of p65 in complex with 14-3-3. A semisynthetic natural product derivative, DP-005, binds to an interface pocket of the p65/14-3-3 complex and concomitantly stabilizes it. Cooperativity analyses of this interaction, and other disease relevant 14-3-3-PPIs, demonstrated selectivity of DP-005 for the p65/14-3-3 complex. The adaptation of a cooperative binding model provided a general approach to characterize stabilization and to assay for selectivity of PPI stabilizers.},

The stabilization of PPIs is a versatile and emerging therapeutic strategy to target specific combinations of protein partners within the protein interactome. Currently, the potency of PPI stabilizers is typically expressed by their apparent affinity or EC50. Here, we propose that the effect of a PPI stabilizer be best described involving the cooperativity factor, $\alpha$, between the stabilizer and binding partners in addition to the intrinsic affinity, KDII, of the stabilizer for one of the apo-proteins. By way of illustration, we combine fluorescence polarization measurements with thermodynamic modeling to determine the $\alpha$ and KDII for the PPI stabilization of 14-3-3 and TASK3 by fusicoccin-A (FC-A) and validate our approach by studying other PPI-partners of 14-3-3 proteins. Finally, we characterize a library of different stabilizer compounds, and perform structure–activity relationship studies in which molecular changes could be attributed to either changes in cooperativity or intrinsic affinity. Such insights should aid in the development of more effective protein–protein stabilizer drugs.},

	abstract = {Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) are a class of bifunctional molecules that can induce the ubiquitin degradation of its target protein by hijacking the E3 ligase to form a target protein-PROTAC-E3 ligase ternary complex. Its underlying principle has inspired the development of a wide range of protein degraders that are similar to or beyond PROTACs in recent years. The formation of the ternary complexes is the key to the success of PROTAC-induced protein degradation. Nevertheless, the lack of effective ternary complex modeling techniques has limited the application of computer-aided drug discovery tools to this emerging and fast developing new land in drug industry. Thus, in this study, we explored the application of the more physically sound molecular dynamics simulation and the molecular mechanics combined with the generalized Born and surface area continuum solvation (MM/GBSA) method to solve the underlying three-body problem in PROTAC modeling. We first verified the accuracy of our approach using a series of known Brd4 BD2 degraders. The calculated binding energy showed a good correlation with the experimental Kd values. The modeling of a unique property, namely, the $\alpha$ value, for PROTACs was also first and accurately performed to our best knowledge. The results also demonstrated the importance of PROTAC-induced protein–protein interactions in its modeling, either qualitatively or quantitatively. Finally, by standing on the success of earlier docking-based approaches, our protocol was also applied as a rescoring function in pose prediction. The results showed a notable improvement in reranking the initial poses generated from a modified Rosetta method, which was reportedly one of the best among a handful of PROTAC modeling approaches available in this field. We hope this work could provide a practical protocol and more insights to study the binding and the design of PROTACs and other protein degraders.},

Molecular glues hold promise as a new generation of therapeutic agents, including those molecular glue degraders that can redirect the protein degradation machinery in a precise way. However, rational discovery of molecular glues is difficult in part due to the lack of understanding of the protein–protein interactions they stabilize.

Detailed analysis shows different mechanisms of ternary structure formation. Additionally, we also review computational approaches for predicting protein–protein interfaces and highlight the promises and challenges.

Both industry and academia have engaged in the identification and use of PPI inhibitors.

Areas covered: PPI stabilization has not been exploited in a systematic manner. Rather, this concept validated by a number of therapeutically used natural products like rapamycin and paclitaxel has been shown retrospectively to be the basis of the activity of synthetic molecules originating from drug discovery projects among them lenalidomide and tafamidis. Here, the authors cover the growing number of synthetic small-molecule PPI stabilizers to advocate for a stronger consideration of this as a drug discovery approach. Expert opinion: Both the natural products and the growing number of synthetic molecules show that PPI stabilization is a viable strategy for drug discovery. There is certainly a significant challenge to adapt compound libraries, screening techniques and downstream methodologies to identify, characterize and optimize PPI stabilizers, but the examples of molecules reviewed here in our opinion justify these efforts.},

Although the structures for these complexes have been determined, there are no evident interactions that can account for the high efficiency of formation of the ternary complex.

	abstract = {The origin of non-additivity in hydrogen bonds (H-bonds), usually termed as H-bond cooperativity, is investigated in H-bonded linear chains. It is shown that H-bond cooperativity originates solely from classical electrostatics. The latter is corroborated by comparing the H-bond cooperativity in infinitely-long H-bonded hydrogen cyanide, 4-pyridone and formamide chains, assessed using density functional theory (DFT), against the strengthening of the dipole–dipole interaction upon the formation of an infinite chain of effective point-dipoles. It is found that the magnitude of these effective point-dipoles is a consequence of mutual polarization and additional effects beyond a polarizable point-dipole model. Nevertheless, the effective point-dipoles are fully determined once a single H-bond is formed, indicating that quantum effects involved in H-bonding are circumscribed to nearest-neighbor interactions only; i.e. in a linear chain of H-bonds, quantum effects do not contribute to the H-bond non-additivity. This finding is verified by estimating cooperativity along the dissociation path of H-bonds in the infinite chains, using two empirical parameters that account for polarizability, together with DFT association energies and molecular dipoles of solely monomers and dimers.},

In this work, using the interaction energy of a molecular system, which is composed of multiple copies of a building block, we propose a quantitative measurement to evaluate the cooperativity effect. This quantification approach is then applied to six molecular systems, i.e., water cluster, argon cluster, protonated water cluster, zinc atom cluster, water cluster on top of a graphene sheet, and alpha helix of glycine amino acids, each with up to 20 copies of the building block. Cooperativity is seen in all these systems. Both positive and negative cooperativity effects are observed. Employing the two energy partition schemes in density functional theory and the information-theoretic quantities such as Shannon entropy, Fisher information, information gain, etc., we then examine the origin of the cooperativity effect for these systems. Strong linear correlations between the cooperativity measure and some of these theoretical quantities have been unveiled. With these correlations, we are able to quantitatively account for their origin of cooperativity. Our results show that the interactions governing the existence and validity of the cooperativity effect are complicated. An opposite mechanism in enthalpy–entropy compensation for positive and negative cooperativity has been unveiled. These results should provide new insights and understandings from a different viewpoint about the nature and origin of cooperativity to appreciate this vastly important chemical concept.},

	abstract = {Direct interactions between proteins are essential for the regulation of their functions in biological pathways. Targeting the complex network of protein–protein interactions (PPIs) has now been widely recognized as an attractive means to therapeutically intervene in disease states. Even though this is a challenging endeavor and PPIs have long been regarded as “undruggable” targets, the last two decades have seen an increasing number of successful examples of PPI modulators, resulting in growing interest in this field. PPI modulation requires novel approaches and the integrated efforts of multiple disciplines to be a fruitful strategy. This perspective focuses on the hub-protein 14-3-3, which has several hundred identified protein interaction partners, and is therefore involved in a wide range of cellular processes and diseases. Here, we aim to provide an integrated overview of the approaches explored for the modulation of 14-3-3 PPIs and review the examples resulting from these efforts in both inhibiting and stabilizing specific 14-3-3 protein complexes by small molecules, peptide mimetics, and natural products.},

Although the reversible association of three components in solution is critical for a vast array of chemical and biological processes, no general physical picture of such systems has emerged. Here we have developed a general, comprehensive framework for understanding ternary complex equilibria, which relates directly to familiar concepts such as EC50 and IC50 from simpler (binary complex) equilibria. Importantly, application of our model to data from the published literature has enabled us to achieve new insights into complex systems ranging from coagulation to therapeutic dosing regimens for monoclonal antibodies. We also provide an Excel spreadsheet to assist readers in both conceptualizing and applying our models. Overall, our analysis has the potential to render complex three-component systems—which have previously been characterized as “analytically intractable”—readily comprehensible to theoreticians and experimentalists alike.},

In recent years, serendipitous discoveries revealed that some preclinical and clinical compounds already work as molecular glue degraders, with many more postulated to destabilize their targets through indirect or yet unresolved mechanisms. Here we review strategies by which E3 ubiquitin ligases can be reprogrammed by monovalent degraders, with a focus on molecular glues hijacking cullin-RING ubiquitin ligases. We argue that such drugs exploit the intrinsic property of proteins to form higher-order assemblies, a phenomenon previously seen with disease-causing sequence variations. Modifications of the protein surface by a bound small molecule can change the interactome of the target protein.

	abstract = {Targeted protein degradation is a pharmacological modality that is based on the induced proximity of an E3 ubiquitin ligase and a target protein to promote target ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation. This has been achieved either via proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs)—bifunctional compounds composed of two separate moieties that individually bind the target and E3 ligase, or via molecular glues that monovalently bind either the ligase or the target1–4. Here, using orthogonal genetic screening, biophysical characterization and structural reconstitution, we investigate the mechanism of action of bifunctional degraders of BRD2 and BRD4, termed intramolecular bivalent glues (IBGs), and find that instead of connecting target and ligase in trans as PROTACs do, they simultaneously engage and connect two adjacent domains of the target protein in cis. This conformational change ‘glues’ BRD4 to the E3 ligases DCAF11 or DCAF16, leveraging intrinsic target–ligase affinities that do not translate to BRD4 degradation in the absence of compound. Structural insights into the ternary BRD4–IBG1–DCAF16 complex guided the rational design of improved degraders of low picomolar potency. We thus introduce a new modality in targeted protein degradation, which works by bridging protein domains in cis to enhance surface complementarity with E3 ligases for productive ubiquitination and degradation.},

	abstract = {Proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs), which induce degradation by recruitment of an E3 ligase to a target protein, are gaining much interest as a new pharmacological modality. However, designing PROTACs is challenging. Formation of a ternary complex between the protein target, the PROTAC, and the recruited E3 ligase is considered paramount for successful degradation. A structural model of this ternary complex could in principle inform rational PROTAC design. Unfortunately, only a handful of structures are available for such complexes, necessitating tools for their modeling. We developed a combined protocol for the modeling of a ternary complex induced by a given PROTAC. Our protocol alternates between sampling of the protein–protein interaction space and the PROTAC molecule conformational space. Application of this protocol—PRosettaC—to a benchmark of known PROTAC ternary complexes results in near-native predictions, with often atomic accuracy prediction of the protein chains, as well as the PROTAC binding moieties. It allowed the modeling of a CRBN/BTK complex that recapitulated experimental results for a series of PROTACs. PRosettaC generated models may be used to design PROTACs for new targets, as well as improve PROTACs for existing targets, potentially cutting down time and synthesis efforts. To enable wide access to this protocol, we have made it available through a web server (https://prosettac.weizmann.ac.il/).},

These enhancers potentiate the ubiquitylation of mutant β-Catenin by β-TrCP in vitro and induce the degradation of an engineered mutant β-Catenin in a cellular system. Distinct from PROTACs, these drug-like small molecules insert into a naturally occurring PPI interface, with contacts optimized for both the substrate and ligase within the same small molecule entity.

Here, we report the crystal structure of a dual-nanobody cannabidiol-sensing system, in which the ligand promotes protein-protein interaction in a manner analogous to auxin. Through quantitative analyses, we draw close parallels among the dual-nanobody cannabidiol sensor, the auxin perception complex, and the IMiDs-bound CRL4CRBN E3, which can bind and ubiquitinate “neo-substrates”. All three systems, including the recruitment of IKZF1 and CK1$\alpha$ to CRBN, are characterized by the lack of ligand binding activity in at least one protein partner and an under-appreciated preexisting low micromolar affinity between the two proteinaceous subunits that is enhanced by the ligand to reach the nanomolar range. These two unifying features define MGs as a special class of proximity inducers distinct from bifunctional compounds and can be used as criteria to guide target selection for future rational discovery of MGs., Molecular glue has been used as a broad term describing a class of protein interaction-promoting compounds.

Evidence suggests that small-molecule MG compounds could essentially target any proteins, which play critical roles in human disease etiology, where many of these protein targets were previously considered undruggable.

The high flexibility of MG–protein interaction profiles provides rich soil for the growth and development of small-molecule MG compounds that can be used as molecular tools to assist in unraveling disease mechanisms, and they can also facilitate drug development for the treatment of human disease, especially human cancer.

The clinical success of thalidomide analogues demonstrates the therapeutic efficacy of drug-induced degradation of transcription factors and other cancer targets1–3, but a substantial subset of proteins are resistant to targeted degradation using existing approaches4,5. Here we report an alternative mechanism of targeted protein degradation, in which a small molecule induces the highly specific, reversible polymerization of a target protein, followed by its sequestration into cellular foci and subsequent degradation. BI-3802 is a small molecule that binds to the Broad-complex, Tramtrack and Bric-à-brac (BTB) domain of the oncogenic transcription factor Bcell lymphoma6 (BCL6) and leads to the proteasomal degradation of BCL66. We use cryo-electron microscopy to reveal how the solvent-exposed moiety of a BCL6-binding molecule contributes to a composite ligand–protein surface that engages BCL6 homodimers to form a supramolecular structure. Drug-induced formation of BCL6 filaments facilitates ubiquitination by the SIAH1 E3 ubiquitin ligase. Our findings demonstrate that a small molecule such as BI-3802 can induce polymerization coupled to highly specific protein degradation, which in the case of BCL6 leads to increased pharmacological activity compared to the effects induced by other BCL6 inhibitors.

The three stereoisomers—R,R, meso, and S,S—of the two constructed dimers were prepared, and in vitro testing showed the R,R forms to be the most potent stereoisomers. The biarylpropylsulfonamides have dramatically increased potencies, more than three orders of magnitude higher than the corresponding monomers. Dimer (R,R)-2a was cocrystallized with the GluR2-S1S2J construct, and an X-ray crystallographic analysis showed (R,R)-2a to bridge two identical binding pockets on two neighboring GluR2 subunits. Thus, this is biostructural evidence of a homomeric dimer bridging two identical receptor-binding sites.},

As a step toward developing treatments for AL patients with substantial cardiac involvement who have difficulty tolerating existing chemotherapy regimens, we introduce small-molecule kinetic stabilizers of the native dimeric structure of full-length LCs, which can slow or stop the amyloidogenicity cascade at its origin. A protease-coupled fluorescence polarization-based high-throughput screen was employed to identify small molecules that kinetically stabilize LCs. NMR and X-ray crystallographic data demonstrate that at least one structural family of hits bind at the LC–LC dimerization interface within full-length LCs, utilizing variable-domain residues that are highly conserved in most AL patients. Stopping the amyloidogenesis cascade at the beginning is a proven strategy to ameliorate postmitotic tissue degeneration.},

Compared to direct inhibition, PPI stabilization is vastly underexplored but has strong advantages, including the ability to gain selectivity by targeting an interface formed only upon association of proteins. Here, we present the application of a site-directed screening technique based on disulfide trapping (tethering) to select for fragments that enhance the affinity between protein partners. We target the phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the hub protein 14-3-3σ and a peptide derived from Estrogen Receptor $\alpha$ (ER$\alpha$), an important breast cancer target that is negatively regulated by 14-3-3σ. We identify orthosteric stabilizers that increase 14-3-3/ER$\alpha$ affinity up to 40-fold and propose the mechanism of stabilization based on X-ray crystal structures. These fragments already display partial selectivity toward ER$\alpha$-like motifs over other representative 14-3-3 clients. This first of its kind study illustrates the potential of the tethering approach to overcome the hurdles in systematic PPI stabilizer discovery.},

The current lack of chemical starting points and focused screening opportunities limits the identification of small molecule stabilizers that engage two proteins simultaneously. Starting from our previously described virtual screening strategy to identify inhibitors of 14-3-3 proteins, we report a conceptual molecular docking approach providing concrete entries for discovery and rational optimization of stabilizers for the interaction of 14-3-3 with the carbohydrate-response element-binding protein (ChREBP). X-ray crystallography reveals a distinct difference in the binding modes between weak and general inhibitors of 14-3-3 complexes and a specific, potent stabilizer of the 14-3-3/ChREBP complex. Structure-guided stabilizer optimization results in selective, up to 26-fold enhancement of the 14-3-3/ChREBP interaction. This study demonstrates the potential of rational design approaches for the development of selective PPI stabilizers starting from weak, promiscuous PPI inhibitors.},

Here we report the X-ray crystal structure of 14-3-3 in complex with the entire binding motif, revealing a previously unidentified mode of interaction. A 14-3-3 dimer simultaneously binds two H+-ATPase peptides, each of which forms a loop within the typical 14-3-3 binding groove and therefore exits from the center of the dimer. Several H+-ATPase mutants support this structure determination. Accordingly, 14-3-3 binding could result in H+-ATPase oligomerization. Indeed, by using single-particle electron cryomicroscopy, the 3D reconstruction of the purified H+-ATPase/14-3-3 complex demonstrates a hexameric arrangement. Fitting of 14-3-3 and H+-ATPase atomic structures into the 3D reconstruction map suggests the spatial arrangement of the holocomplex.},

A co-crystal structure of macroPROTAC-1 bound in a ternary complex with VHL and the second bromodomain of Brd4 validated the rational design. Biophysical studies revealed enhanced discrimination between the second and the first bromodomains of BET proteins.

Here we report the crystal structure of a ternary complex containing the peroxisome proliferator-activated receptor-$\alpha$ ligand-binding domain bound to the antagonist GW6471 and a SMRT co-repressor motif. In this structure, the co-repressor motif adopts a three-turn $\alpha$-helix that prevents the carboxy-terminal activation helix (AF-2) of the receptor from assuming the active conformation.

High-resolution ternary complex crystal structures and biophysical investigation guided rational and efficient optimization toward ACBI1, a potent and cooperative degrader of SMARCA2, SMARCA4 and PBRM1.

However, inhibitors that block protein-protein interactions (PPIs) between WDR5 and its binding partners exhibit modest cancer cell killing effects and lack in vivo efficacy. Here, we present pharmacological degradation of WDR5 as a promising therapeutic strategy for treating WDR5-dependent tumors and report two high-resolution crystal structures of WDR5-degrader-E3 ligase ternary complexes. We identified an effective WDR5 degrader via structure-based design and demonstrated its in vitro and in vivo antitumor activities. On the basis of the crystal structure of an initial WDR5 degrader in complex with WDR5 and the E3 ligase von Hippel–Lindau (VHL), we designed a WDR5 degrader, MS67, and demonstrated the high cooperativity of MS67 binding to WDR5 and VHL by another ternary complex structure and biophysical characterization. MS67 potently and selectively depleted WDR5 and was more effective than WDR5 PPI inhibitors in suppressing transcription of WDR5-regulated genes, decreasing the chromatin-bound fraction of MLL complex components and c-MYC, and inhibiting the proliferation of cancer cells. In addition, MS67 suppressed malignant growth of MLL-rearranged acute myeloid leukemia patient cells in vitro and in vivo and was well tolerated in vivo. Collectively, our results demonstrate that structure-based design can be an effective strategy to identify highly active degraders and suggest that pharmacological degradation of WDR5 might be a promising treatment for WDR5-dependent cancers.},

The ligand-binding domain of cereblon is found, with a high degree of conservation, in both bacteria and eukaryotes. Using a bacterial model system, we reveal the structural determinants of cereblon substrate recognition, based on a series of high-resolution crystal structures. For the first time, we identify a cellular ligand that is universally present: we show that thalidomide and its derivatives mimic and compete for the binding of uridine, and validate these findings in vivo. The nature of the binding pocket, an aromatic cage of three tryptophan residues, further suggests a role in the recognition of cationic ligands. Our results allow for general evaluation of pharmaceuticals for potential cereblon-dependent teratogenicity.},

InhA, the enoyl acyl carrier protein reductase (ENR) from M. tuberculosis, is one of the key enzymes involved in the mycobacterial fatty acid elongation cycle and has been validated as an effective antimicrobial target. We report here the discovery, through high-throughput screening, of a series of pyrrolidine carboxamides as a novel class of potent InhA inhibitors. Crystal structures of InhA complexed with three inhibitors have been used to elucidate the inhibitor binding mode. The potency of the lead compound was improved over 160-fold by subsequent optimization through iterative microtiter library synthesis followed by in situ activity screening without purification. Resolution of racemic mixtures of several inhibitors indicate that only one enantiomer is active as an inhibitor of InhA.},

	abstract = {Antimalarial chemotherapy continues to be challenging in view of the emergence of drug resistance, especially artemisinin resistance in Southeast Asia. It is critical that novel antimalarial drugs are identified that inhibit new targets with unexplored mechanisms of action. It has been demonstrated that the immunosuppressive drug rapamycin, which is currently in clinical use to prevent organ-transplant rejection, has antimalarial effects. The Plasmodium falciparum target protein is PfFKBP35, a unique immunophilin FK506-binding protein (FKBP). This protein family binds rapamycin, FK506 and other immunosuppressive and non-immunosuppressive macrolactones. Here, two crystallographic structures of rapamycin in complex with the FK506-binding domain of PfFKBP35 at high resolution, in both its oxidized and reduced forms, are reported. In comparison with the human FKBP12–rapamycin complex reported previously, the structures reveal differences in the β4–β6 segment that lines the rapamycin binding site. Structural differences between the Plasmodium protein and human hFKBP12 include the replacement of Cys106 and Ser109 by His87 and Ile90, respectively. The proximity of Cys106 to the bound rapamycin molecule (4–5 Å) suggests possible routes for the rational design of analogues of rapamycin with specific antiparasitic activity. Comparison of the structures with the PfFKBD–FK506 complex shows that both drugs interact with the same binding-site residues. These two new structures highlight the structural differences and the specific interactions that must be kept in consideration for the rational design of rapamycin analogues with antimalarial activity that specifically bind to PfFKBP35 without immunosuppressive effects.},

We screened the human C2H2 zinc finger proteome for degradation in the presence of thalidomide analogs, identifying 11 zinc finger degrons. Structural and functional characterization of the C2H2 zinc finger degrons demonstrates how diverse zinc finger domains bind the permissive drug-CRBN interface. Computational zinc finger docking and biochemical analysis predict that more than 150 zinc fingers bind the drug-CRBN complex in vitro, and we show that selective zinc finger degradation can be achieved through compound modifications.

	abstract = {Caspases play important roles during apoptosis, inflammation and proliferation. The high homology among family members makes selective targeting of individual caspases difficult, which is necessary to precisely define the role of these enzymes. We have selected caspase-7-specific binders from a library of DARPins (designed ankyrin repeat proteins). The DARPins D7.18 and D7.43 bind specifically to procaspase 7 and active caspase 7, but not to other members of the family. Binding of the DARPins does not affect the active enzyme, but interferes with its activation by other caspases. The crystal structure of the caspase 7–D7.18 complex elucidates the high selectivity and the mode of inhibition. Combining these caspase-7-specific DARPins with the previously reported caspase-3-inhibitory DARPin D3.4S76R reduces the activity of caspase 3 and 7 in double-transfected HeLa cells during apoptosis. In addition, these cells showed less susceptibility to TRAIL (tumour-necrosis-factor-related apoptosis-inducing ligand)-induced apoptosis in living cell experiments. D7.18 and D7.43 are therefore novel tools for in vitro studies on procaspase 7 activation as well as for clarifying the role of its activation in different cellular processes. If applied in combination with D3.4S76R, they represent an excellent instrument to increase our understanding of these enzymes during various cellular processes.},

	abstract = {Invasive fungal infections remain difficult to treat and require novel targeting strategies. The 12-kDa FK506-binding protein (FKBP12) is a ubiquitously expressed peptidyl-prolyl isomerase with considerable homology between fungal pathogens and is thus a prime candidate for future targeting efforts to generate a panfungal strategy. Despite decades of research on FKBPs, their substrates and mechanisms of action remain unclear. Here we describe structural, biochemical, and in vivo analyses of FKBP12s from the pathogenic fungi Candida albicans, Candida glabrata, and Aspergillus fumigatus. Strikingly, multiple apo A. fumigatus and C. albicans FKBP12 crystal structures revealed a symmetric, intermolecular interaction involving the deep insertion of an active-site loop proline into the active-site pocket of an adjacent subunit. Such interactions have not been observed in previous FKBP structures. This finding indicates the possibility that this is a self-substrate interaction unique to the A. fumigatus and C. albicans fungal proteins that contain this central proline. Structures obtained with the proline in the cis and trans states provide more data in support of self-catalysis. Moreover, cysteine cross-linking experiments captured the interacting dimer, supporting the idea that it forms in solution. Finally, genetic studies exploring the impact of mutations altering the central proline and an adjacent residue provide evidence that any dimeric state formed in vivo, where FKBP12 concentrations are low, is transient. Taken together, these findings suggest a unique mechanism of self-substrate regulation by fungal FKBP12s, lending further novel understanding of this protein for future drug-targeting efforts.IMPORTANCE FKBP12 is a cis-trans peptidyl-prolyl isomerase that plays key roles in cellular protein homeostasis. FKBP12s also bind the immunosuppressive drug FK506 to inhibit the phosphatase calcineurin (CaN). CaN is required for virulence of A. fumigatus, C. albicans, C. glabrata, and other deadly fungal pathogens, marking FKBP12 and CaN as potential broad-spectrum drug targets. Here we describe structures of fungal FKBP12s. Multiple apo A. fumigatus and C. albicans FKBP12 structures reveal the insertion of a proline, conspicuously conserved in these proteins, into the active sites of adjacent molecules. This suggests that these proteins might serve as their own substrates. Cysteine disulfide trapping experiments provide support for this self-interaction and hence possible intermolecular catalysis by these enzymes.},

Induced protein degradation is an alternative approach that is ‘event-driven’: upon drug binding, the target protein is tagged for elimination. Emerging technologies based on proteolysis-targeting chimeras (PROTACs) that exploit cellular quality control machinery to selectively degrade target proteins are attracting considerable attention in the pharmaceutical industry owing to the advantages they could offer over traditional small-molecule strategies. These advantages include the potential to reduce systemic drug exposure, the ability to counteract increased target protein expression that often accompanies inhibition of protein function and the potential ability to target proteins that are not currently therapeutically tractable, such as transcription factors, scaffolding and regulatory proteins.},

One of the best-characterized enzymes that catalyzes the attachment of ubiquitin to proteins is a ubiquitin ligase complex, Skp1-Cullin-F box complex containing Hrt1 (SCF). We sought to artificially target a protein to the SCF complex for ubiquitination and degradation. To this end, we tested methionine aminopeptidase-2 (MetAP-2), which covalently binds the angiogenesis inhibitor ovalicin. A chimeric compound, protein-targeting chimeric molecule 1 (Protac-1), was synthesized to recruit MetAP-2 to SCF. One domain of Protac-1 contains the IκB$\alpha$ phosphopeptide that is recognized by the F-box protein β-TRCP, whereas the other domain is composed of ovalicin. We show that MetAP-2 can be tethered to SCFβ-TRCP, ubiquitinated, and degraded in a Protac-1-dependent manner.

In the 20 years since the concept of a proteolysis-targeting chimera (PROTAC) molecule harnessing the ubiquitin–proteasome system to degrade a target protein was reported, TPD has moved from academia to industry, where numerous companies have disclosed programmes in preclinical and early clinical development. With clinical proof-of-concept for PROTAC molecules against two well-established cancer targets provided in 2020, the field is poised to pursue targets that were previously considered ‘undruggable’. In this Review, we summarize the first two decades of PROTAC discovery and assess the current landscape, with a focus on industry activity. We then discuss key areas for the future of TPD, including establishing the target classes for which TPD is most suitable, expanding the use of ubiquitin ligases to enable precision medicine and extending the modality beyond oncology.},

	abstract = {Although many kinds of therapies are applied in the clinic, drug-resistance is a major and unavoidable problem. Another disturbing statistic is the limited number of drug targets, which are presently only 20–25\% of all protein targets that are currently being studied. Moreover, the focus of current explorations of targets are their enzymatic functions, which ignores the functions from their scaffold moiety. As a promising and appealing technology, PROteolysis TArgeting Chimeras (PROTACs) have attracted great attention both from academia and industry for finding available approaches to solve the above problems. PROTACs regulate protein function by degrading target proteins instead of inhibiting them, providing more sensitivity to drug-resistant targets and a greater chance to affect the nonenzymatic functions. PROTACs have been proven to show better selectivity compared to classic inhibitors. PROTACs can be described as a chemical knockdown approach with rapidity and reversibility, which presents new and different biology compared to other gene editing tools by avoiding misinterpretations that arise from potential genetic compensation and/or spontaneous mutations. PRTOACs have been widely explored throughout the world and have outperformed not only in cancer diseases, but also in immune disorders, viral infections and neurodegenerative diseases. Although PROTACs present a very promising and powerful approach for crossing the hurdles of present drug discovery and tool development in biology, more efforts are needed to gain to get deeper insight into the efficacy and safety of PROTACs in the clinic. More target binders and more E3 ligases applicable for developing PROTACs are waiting for exploration.},

	abstract = {Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are essential for biological processes including immune reactions and diseases. Inhibition of PPIs by drug-like compounds is a common basis for therapeutic approaches. In many cases the flat interface of PP complexes prevents discovery of specific compound binding to cavities on one partner and PPI inhibition. However, frequently new pockets are formed at the PP interface that allow accommodation of stabilizers which is often as desirable as inhibition but a much less explored alternative strategy. Herein, we employ molecular dynamics simulations and pocket detection to investigate 18 known stabilizers and associated PP complexes. For most cases, we find that a dual-binding mechanism, a similar stabilizer interaction strength with each protein partner, is an important prerequisite for effective stabilization. A few stabilizers follow an allosteric mechanism by stabilizing the protein bound structure and/or increase the PPI indirectly. On 226 protein–protein complexes, we find in {\textbackslash}textgreater75\% of the cases interface cavities suitable for binding of drug-like compounds. We propose a computational compound identification workflow that exploits new PP interface cavities and optimizes the dual-binding mechanism and apply it to 5 PP complexes. Our study demonstrates a great potential for in silico PPI stabilizers discovery with a wide range of therapeutic applications.},

	abstract = {Proteins with multiple binding sites play important roles in cell signaling systems by nucleating protein complexes in which, for example, enzymes and substrates are co-localized. Proteins that specialize in this function are called by a variety names, including adapter, linker and scaffold. Scaffold-mediated nucleation of protein complexes can be either constitutive or induced. Induced nucleation is commonly mediated by a docking site on a scaffold that is activated by phosphorylation. Here, by considering minimalist mathematical models, which recapitulate scaffold effects seen in more mechanistically detailed models, we obtain analytical and numerical results that provide insights into scaffold function. These results elucidate how recruitment of a pair of ligands to a scaffold depends on the concentrations of the ligands, on the binding constants for ligand–scaffold interactions, on binding cooperativity, and on the milieu of the scaffold, as ligand recruitment is affected by competitive ligands and decoy receptors. For the case of a bivalent scaffold, we obtain an expression for the unique scaffold concentration that maximally recruits a pair of monovalent ligands. Through simulations, we demonstrate that a bivalent scaffold can nucleate distinct sets of ligands to equivalent extents when the scaffold is present at different concentrations. Thus, the function of a scaffold can potentially change qualitatively with a change in copy number. We also demonstrate how a scaffold can change the catalytic efficiency of an enzyme and the sensitivity of the rate of reaction to substrate concentration. The results presented here should be useful for understanding scaffold function and for engineering scaffolds to have desired properties.},

Common neosubstrates include Aiolos, Ikaros, GSPT1, CK1$\alpha$, and SALL4. Unlike achieving potency and selectivity for traditional small molecule inhibitors, reducing the degradation of these neosubstrates is complicated by the ternary nature of the complex formed between the protein, CRBN, and CELMoD. The standard guiding principles of medicinal chemistry, such as enforcing hydrogen bond formation, are less predictive of degradation efficiency and selectivity. Disclosed is an analysis of our glutarimide CELMoD library to identify interpretable chemical features correlated to selectivity profiles and general cytotoxicity.

Despite the importance of this key intermediate species, no detailed validation of a method to directly determine binding parameters for ternary complex kinetics has been reported, and it remains to be addressed whether tuning the kinetics of PROTAC ternary complexes may be an effective strategy to improve the efficiency of targeted protein degradation. Here, we develop an SPR-based assay to quantify the stability of PROTAC-induced ternary complexes by measuring for the first time the kinetics of their formation and dissociation in vitro using purified proteins. We benchmark our assay using four PROTACs that target the bromodomains (BDs) of bromodomain and extraterminal domain proteins Brd2, Brd3, and Brd4 to the von Hippel–Lindau E3 ligase (VHL). We reveal marked differences in ternary complex off-rates for different PROTACs that exhibit either positive or negative cooperativity for ternary complex formation relative to binary binding. The positively cooperative degrader MZ1 forms comparatively stable and long-lived ternary complexes with either Brd4BD2 or Brd2BD2 and VHL. Equivalent complexes with Brd3BD2 are destabilized due to a single amino acid difference (Glu/Gly swap) present in the bromodomain. We observe that this difference in ternary complex dissociative half-life correlates to a greater initial rate of intracellular degradation of Brd2 and Brd4 relative to Brd3. These findings establish a novel assay to measure the kinetics of PROTAC ternary complexes and elucidate the important kinetic parameters that drive effective target degradation.},

	abstract = {Estimating intrinsic from apparent cooperativities to calculate concentrations of ternary complexes in biochemical and cellular assays. , There is an increasing interest to develop therapeutics that modulate challenging or undruggable target proteins via a mechanism that involves ternary complexes. In general, such compounds can be characterized by their direct affinities to a chaperone and a target protein and by their degree of cooperativity in the formation of the ternary complex. As a trend, smaller compounds have a greater dependency on intrinsic cooperativity to their thermodynamic stability relative to direct target (or chaperone) binding. This highlights the need to consider intrinsic cooperativity of ternary complex-forming compounds early in lead optimization, especially as they provide more control over target selectivity (especially for isoforms) and more insight into the relationship between target occupancy and target response via estimation of ternary complex concentrations. This motivates the need to quantify the natural constant of intrinsic cooperativity ( $\alpha$ ) which is generally defined as the gain (or loss) in affinity of a compound to its target in pre-bound vs. unbound state. Intrinsic cooperativities can be retrieved via a mathematical binding model from EC 50 shifts of binary binding curves of the ternary complex-forming compound with either a target or chaperone relative to the same experiment but in the presence of the counter protein. In this manuscript, we present a mathematical modeling methodology that estimates the intrinsic cooperativity value from experimentally observed apparent cooperativities. This method requires only the two binary binding affinities and the protein concentrations of target and chaperone and is therefore suitable for use in early discovery therapeutic programs. This approach is then extended from biochemical assays to cellular assays ( i.e. , from a closed system to an open system) by accounting for differences in total ligand vs. free ligand concentrations in the calculations of ternary complex concentrations. Finally, this model is used to translate biochemical potency of ternary complex-forming compounds into expected cellular target occupancy, which could ultimately serve as a way for validation or de-validation of hypothesized biological mechanisms of action.},

Drastically different from the widely employed but extremely expensive normal mode method for calculating entropy change in protein–ligand binding, the new method calculates the entropic component (interaction entropy or −TΔS) of the binding free energy directly from molecular dynamics simulation without any extra computational cost. Extensive study of over a dozen randomly selected protein–ligand binding systems demonstrated that this interaction entropy method is both computationally efficient and numerically reliable and is vastly superior to the standard normal mode approach. This interaction entropy paradigm introduces a novel and intuitive conceptual understanding of the entropic effect in protein–ligand binding and other general interaction systems as well as a practical method for highly efficient calculation of this effect.},

Lipaemia, cross-reactivity, and exogenous interferences due to pre-analytical variation, matrix and equipment reaction also affect immunoassay. Interfering substances may lead to falsely elevated or falsely low analyte concentration in one or more assay systems depending on the site of the interference in the reaction and possibly result in discordant results for other analytes. The prevalence of interference is generally low in assays containing blocking agents that neutralise or inhibit the interference but is often higher in new, untested immunoassays. A wide range of analytes measured by immunoassay including hormones, tumour markers, drugs, cardiac troponin and microbial serology may be affected., Interference in immunoassay may lead to the misinterpretation of a patient's results by the laboratory and the wrong course of treatment being given by the physician. Laboratories should put processes in place to detect, test and report suspected interferences. It is equally important that physicians communicate any clinical suspicion of discordance between the clinical and the laboratory data to the laboratory. The detection of interference may require the use of an alternate assay or additional measurements, before and after treatment with additional blocking reagent, or following dilution of the sample in non-immune serum.

Besides the Nwat parameter, the effect of the force field, the molecular dynamics simulation length, and the implicit solvent model used in the MMGBSA analysis have been also evaluated. We found that considering 30 interfacial water molecules improved the correlation between predicted and experimental binding energies by up to 30\%, compared to the standard approach.

This method demonstrated improved correlations between calculated and experimental binding energies in both protein-protein interactions and ligand-receptor complexes, in comparison to the standard MM-GBSA. A protocol optimization, aimed to maximize efficacy and efficiency, is discussed here considering penicillopepsin, HIV1-protease, and BCL-XL as test cases. Calculations were performed in triplicates on both classic HPC environments and on standard workstations equipped by a GPU card, evidencing no statistical differences in the results. No relevant differences in correlation to experiments were also observed when performing Nwat-MMGBSA calculations on 4 or 1 ns long trajectories. A fully automatic workflow for structure-based virtual screening, performing from library set-up to docking and Nwat-MMGBSA rescoring, has then been developed. The protocol has been tested against no rescoring or standard MM-GBSA rescoring within a retrospective virtual screening of inhibitors of AmpC β-lactamase and of the Rac1-Tiam1 protein-protein interaction. In both cases, Nwat-MMGBSA rescoring provided a statistically significant increase in the ROC AUCs of between 20 and 30\%, compared to docking scoring or to standard MM-GBSA rescoring.{\textbackslash}textless/p{\textbackslash}textgreater},

	abstract = {Abstract Tetrameric haemoglobins display a cooperative ligand binding behaviour, which has been attributed to the functional interrelationship between multiple ligand binding sites. The quantitative description of this feature was initially carried out with a phenomenological approach, which was limited to the functional effect of the occupancy by a ligand molecule of a binding site on further binding steps. However, subsequent development of structural–functional models for the description of the cooperativity in haemoglobin brought about a much deeper information on the interrelationships between ligand binding at the heme and structural variations occurring in the surrounding free subunits. This approach opened the way to the evolution of the concept of allostery, which is intended as the structural–functional effect exerted by the presence of a ligand in a binding site on other binding sites present in the same molecule. This concept can be applied to either sites for the same ligand (homotropic allostery) and for sites of different ligands (heterotropic allostery). Several models trying to take into account the continuous building up of structural and functional information on the physicochemical properties of haemoglobin have been developed along this line. © 2008 IUBMB IUBMB Life, 60(2): 112–123, 2008},

Hydrophobic contacts in the 1992 Protein Data Bank have the type of "topological localness" predicted by the hypothesis. The HZ paths for amino acid sequences that mimic crambin and bovine pancreatic trypsin inhibitor are quickly found by computer; the best configurations thus reached have single hydrophobic cores that are within about 3 kcal/mol of the global minimum. This hypothesis shows how proteins could find globally optimal states without exhaustive search.},

An increasingly popular solution is to increase the mass of the hydrogen atoms to {\textbackslash}textasciitilde3 amu and decrease the mass of the parent atom by an equivalent amount. This approach, known as hydrogen-mass repartitioning (HMR), permits time steps up to 4 fs with reasonable simulation stability. While HMR has been applied in many published studies to date, it has not been extensively tested for membrane-containing systems. Here, we compare the results of simulations of a variety of membranes and membrane-protein systems run using a 2-fs time step and a 4-fs time step with HMR. For pure membrane systems, we find almost no difference in structural properties, such as area-per-lipid, electron density profiles, and order parameters, although there are differences in kinetic properties such as the diffusion constant. Conductance through a porin in an applied field, partitioning of a small peptide, hydrogen-bond dynamics, and membrane mixing show very little dependence on HMR and the time step. We also tested a 9-Å cutoff compared to the standard CHARMM cutoff of 12 Å, finding significant deviations in many properties tested. We conclude that HMR is a valid approach for membrane systems but a 9-Å cutoff is not.,},

Like SHAKE, it is based on the Verlet algorithm and retains the simplicity of using Cartesian coordinates for each of the atoms to describe the configuration of a molecule with internal constraints. RATTLE guarantees that the coordinates and velocities of the atoms in a molecule satisfy the internal constraints at each time step. RATTLE has two advantages over SHAKE. On computers of fixed precision, it is of higher precision than SHAKE. Since it deals directly with the velocities, it is easier to modify RATTLE for use with the recently developed constant temperature and constant pressure molecular dynamics methods and with the nonequilibrium molecular dynamics methods that make use of rescaling of the atomic velocities.},

To systematically evaluate the performance of these methods, we report here an extensive study of 59 ligands interacting with six different proteins. First, we explored the effects of the length of the molecular dynamics (MD) simulation, ranging from 400 to 4800 ps, and the solute dielectric constant (1, 2, or 4) on the binding free energies predicted by MM/PBSA. The following three important conclusions could be observed: (1) MD simulation length has an obvious impact on the predictions, and longer MD simulation is not always necessary to achieve better predictions. (2) The predictions are quite sensitive to the solute dielectric constant, and this parameter should be carefully determined according to the characteristics of the protein/ligand binding interface. (3) Conformational entropy often show large fluctuations in MD trajectories, and a large number of snapshots are necessary to achieve stable predictions. Next, we evaluated the accuracy of the binding free energies calculated by three Generalized Born (GB) models. We found that the GB model developed by Onufriev and Case was the most successful model in ranking the binding affinities of the studied inhibitors. Finally, we evaluated the performance of MM/GBSA and MM/PBSA in predicting binding free energies. Our results showed that MM/PBSA performed better in calculating absolute, but not necessarily relative, binding free energies than MM/GBSA. Considering its computational efficiency, MM/GBSA can serve as a powerful tool in drug design, where correct ranking of inhibitors is often emphasized.},

However, an accurate estimation of protein−ligand binding aﬃnity still remains a challenge due to the intrinsic limitation of the standard generalized Born (GB) model used in MM/GBSA. In this study, we proposed and evaluated the MM/GBSA approach based on a variable dielectric generalized Born (VDGB) model using residue-type-based dielectric constants. In the VDGB model, diﬀerent dielectric values were assigned for the three types of protein residues, and the magnitude of the dielectric constants for residue types follows this order: charged ≥ polar ≥ nonpolar. We found that MM/GBSA based on a VDGB model (MM/GBSAVDGB) with an optimal dielectric constant of 4.0 for the charged residues and 1.0 for the noncharged residues together with a net-charge-dependent dielectric value for ligands achieved better predictions as judged by Pearson’s correlation coeﬃcient than the standard MM/GBSA with a uniform solute dielectric constant of 4.0 for the training set of 130 protein−ligand complexes. The prediction on the test set with 165 protein−ligand complexes also validated the better performance of MM/GBSAVDGB. Moreover, this method exhibited potential in predicting the relative binding free energies for multiple ligands against the same target. Furthermore, we found that rational truncation of protein residues far from the binding site can signiﬁcantly speed up the MM/GBSAVDGB calculations, while it almost does not inﬂuence the prediction accuracy. Therefore, it is feasible to implement the system-truncated MM/GBSAVDGB as a scoring function for SBDD.},

The structures of PPIs were predicted by combining the ATTRACT docking and the HawkRank re-scoring, and the key residues for PPIs were highlighted by the MM/GBSA free energy decomposition. The molecular visualization was supported by 3Dmol.js. For the structural modeling of PPIs, HawkDock could achieve a better performance than ZDOCK 3.0.2 in the benchmark testing.

	abstract = {The solvation free energies of ions in water are consistent with the Born linear response model if the centre on which the ion–water repulsion force acts is moved from the oxygen atom towards the hydrogens. , Accurate models of the free energies of ions in solution are crucially important. They can be used to predict and understand the properties of electrolyte solutions in the huge number of important applications where these solutions play a central role such as electrochemical energy storage. The Born model, developed to describe ion solvation free energies, is widely considered to be critically flawed as it predicts a linear response of water to ionic charge, which fails to match water's supposed intrinsic preference to solvate anions over cations. Here, we demonstrate that the asymmetric response observed in simulation is the result of an arbitrary choice of the oxygen atom to be the centre of a water molecule. We show that an alternative and reasonable choice, which places the centre 0.5 Å towards the hydrogen atoms, results in a linear and charge symmetric response of water to ionic charge for a classical water model consistent with the Born model. Therefore, this asymmetry should be regarded as a property of the specific short-range repulsive interaction not an intrinsic electrostatic property of water and so the fact that the Born model does not reproduce it is not a limitation of this approach. We also show that this new water centre results in a more reasonable surface potential contribution to the solvation free energies.},

	abstract = {We present a new self-consistent reaction-ﬁeld implicit solvation model that employs the generalized Born approximation for the bulk electrostatic contribution to the free energy of solvation. The new solvation model (SM) is called SM12 (where ″12″ stands for 2012), and it is available with two sets of parameters, SM12CM5 and SM12ESP. The SM12CM5 parametrization is based on CM5 partial atomic charges, and the SM12ESP parametrization is based on charges derived from a quantum-mechanically calculated electrostatic potential (ESP) (in particular, we consider ChElPG and Merz−Kollman−Singh charges). The model was parametrized over 10 combinations of theoretical levels including the 6-31G(d) and MG3S basis sets and the B3LYP, mPW1PW, M06-L, M06, and M06-2X density functionals against 2979 reference experimental data. The reference data include 2503 solvation free energies and 144 transfer free energies of neutral solutes composed of H, C, N, O, F, Si, P, S, Cl, Br, and I in water and in 90 organic solvents as well as 332 solvation free energies of singly charged anions and cations in acetonitrile, dimethyl sulfoxide, methanol, and water. The advantages of the new solvation model over our previous generalized Born model (SM8) and all other previous generalized Born solvation models are (i) like the SMD model based on electron density distributions, it may be applied with a single set of parameters with arbitrary extended basis sets, whereas the SM8 model involves CM4 or CM4M charges that become unstable for extended basis sets, (ii) it is parametrized against a more diverse training sets than any previous solvation model, and (iii) it is deﬁned for the entire periodic table.},

Here, we present a study on the relationship between binding affinity and the size and chemical nature of protein–protein interfaces. Our analysis focuses on heterodimers and includes curated structural and thermodynamic data for 113 complexes. We observe a direct correlation between binding affinity and the amount of surface area buried at the interface. For a given amount of surface area buried, the binding affinity spans four orders of magnitude in terms of the dissociation constant (Kd). Across the entire dataset, we observe no obvious relationship between binding affinity and the chemical composition of the interface. We also calculate the free energy per unit surface area buried, or “surface energy density,” of each heterodimer. For interfacial surface areas between 500 and 2000 Å2, the surface energy density decreases as the buried surface area increases. As the buried surface area increases beyond about 2000 Å2, the surface energy density levels off to a constant value. We believe that these analyses and data will be useful for researchers with an interest in understanding, designing or inhibiting protein–protein interfaces.},

This year’s update, DrugBank 5.0, represents the most significant upgrade to the database in more than 10 years. In many cases, existing data content has grown by 100\% or more over the last update. For instance, the total number of investigational drugs in the database has grown by almost 300\%, the number of drug-drug interactions has grown by nearly 600\% and the number of SNP-associated drug effects has grown more than 3000\%. Significant improvements have been made to the quantity, quality and consistency of drug indications, drug binding data as well as drug-drug and drug-food interactions. A great deal of brand new data have also been added to DrugBank 5.0. This includes information on the influence of hundreds of drugs on metabolite levels (pharmacometabolomics), gene expression levels (pharmacotranscriptomics) and protein expression levels (pharmacoprotoemics). New data have also been added on the status of hundreds of new drug clinical trials and existing drug repurposing trials.

This is further complicated by the presence of water molecules, which can exhibit transient interactions of variable duration and strength with the protein surface. The T-cell receptor (TCR) and its staphylococcal enterotoxin 3 (SEC3) binding partner are well-characterized examples of a protein−protein interaction system exhibiting interfacial plasticity, cooperativity, and additivity among mutants. Specifically engineered mutants induce intercalating interfacial water molecules, which subsequently enhance protein−protein binding affinity. In this work, we perform a set of molecular mechanics (MM) Poisson−Boltzmann (PB) surface area (SA) calculations on the wild type and two mutant TCR-SEC3 systems and show that the method is able to discriminate between weak and strong binders only when key explicit water molecules are included in the analysis. The results presented here point to the promise of MM-PBSA toward rationalizing molecular recognition at protein−protein interfaces, while establishing a general approach to handle explicit interfacial water molecules in such calculations.},

Here, a popular analytical Generalized Born (GB) solvation model is modified to improve its accuracy in calculating the solvent polarization part of free energy changes in large-scale conformational transitions, such as protein folding. In contrast to an earlier GB model (implemented in the AMBER-6 program), the improved version does not overstabilize the native structures relative to the finite-difference Poisson–Boltzmann continuum treatment. In addition to improving the energy balance between folded and unfolded conformers, the algorithm (available in the AMBER-7 and NAB molecular modeling packages) is shown to perform well in more than 50 ns of native-state molecular dynamics (MD) simulations of thioredoxin, protein-A, and ubiquitin, as well as in a simulation of Barnase/Barstar complex formation. For thioredoxin, various combinations of input parameters have been explored, such as the underlying gas-phase force fields and the atomic radii. The best performance is achieved with a previously proposed modification to the torsional potential in the Amber ff99 force field, which yields stable native trajectories for all of the tested proteins, with backbone root-mean-square deviations from the native structures being ∼1.5 Å after 6 ns of simulation time. The structure of Barnase/Barstar complex is regenerated, starting from an unbound state, to within 1.9 Å relative to the crystal structure of the complex.

Through an enormous experimental effort1–4, the structures of around 100,000 unique proteins have been determined5, but this represents a small fraction of the billions of known protein sequences6,7. Structural coverage is bottlenecked by the months to years of painstaking effort required to determine a single protein structure. Accurate computational approaches are needed to address this gap and to enable large-scale structural bioinformatics. Predicting the three-dimensional structure that a protein will adopt based solely on its amino acid sequence—the structure prediction component of the ‘protein folding problem’8—has been an important open research problem for more than 50 years9. Despite recent progress10–14, existing methods fall far short of atomic accuracy, especially when no homologous structure is available. Here we provide the first computational method that can regularly predict protein structures with atomic accuracy even in cases in which no similar structure is known. We validated an entirely redesigned version of our neural network-based model, AlphaFold, in the challenging 14th Critical Assessment of protein Structure Prediction (CASP14)15, demonstrating accuracy competitive with experimental structures in a majority of cases and greatly outperforming other methods. Underpinning the latest version of AlphaFold is a novel machine learning approach that incorporates physical and biological knowledge about protein structure, leveraging multi-sequence alignments, into the design of the deep learning algorithm.},

	abstract = {While the vast majority of well-structured single protein chains can now be predicted to high accuracy due to the recent AlphaFold [1] model, the prediction of multi-chain protein complexes remains a challenge in many cases. In this work, we demonstrate that an AlphaFold model trained specifically for multimeric inputs of known stoichiometry, which we call AlphaFold-Multimer, significantly increases accuracy of predicted multimeric interfaces over input-adapted single-chain AlphaFold while maintaining high intra-chain accuracy. On a benchmark dataset of 17 heterodimer proteins without templates (introduced in [2]) we achieve at least medium accuracy (DockQ [3] ≥ 0.49) on 13 targets and high accuracy (DockQ ≥ 0.8) on 7 targets, compared to 9 targets of at least medium accuracy and 4 of high accuracy for the previous state of the art system (an AlphaFold-based system from [2]). We also predict structures for a large dataset of 4,446 recent protein complexes, from which we score all non-redundant interfaces with low template identity. For heteromeric interfaces we successfully predict the interface (DockQ ≥ 0.23) in 70\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions (DockQ ≥ 0.8) in 26\% of cases, an improvement of +27 and +14 percentage points over the flexible linker modification of AlphaFold [4] respectively. For homomeric inter-faces we successfully predict the interface in 72\% of cases, and produce high accuracy predictions in 36\% of cases, an improvement of +8 and +7 percentage points respectively.},

	abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations have become increasingly popular in studying the motions and functions of biomolecules. The accuracy of the simulation, however, is highly determined by the molecular mechanics (MM) force field (FF), a set of functions with adjustable parameters to compute the potential energies from atomic positions. However, the overall quality of the FF, such as our previously published ff99SB and ff14SB, can be limited by assumptions that were made years ago. In the updated model presented here (ff19SB), we have significantly improved the backbone profiles for all 20 amino acids. We fit coupled φ/ψ parameters using 2D φ/ψ conformational scans for multiple amino acids, using as reference data the entire 2D quantum mechanics (QM) energy surface. We address the polarization inconsistency during dihedral parameter fitting by using both QM and MM in aqueous solution. Finally, we examine possible dependency of the backbone fitting on side chain rotamer. To extensively validate ff19SB parameters, and to compare to results using other Amber models, we have performed a total of ∼5 ms MD simulations in explicit solvent. Our results show that after amino-acid-specific training against QM data with solvent polarization, ff19SB not only reproduces the differences in amino-acid-specific Protein Data Bank (PDB) Ramachandran maps better but also shows significantly improved capability to differentiate amino-acid-dependent properties such as helical propensities. We also conclude that an inherent underestimation of helicity is present in ff14SB, which is (inexactly) compensated for by an increase in helical content driven by the TIP3P bias toward overly compact structures. In summary, ff19SB, when combined with a more accurate water model such as OPC, should have better predictive power for modeling sequence-specific behavior, protein mutations, and also rational protein design. Of the explicit water models tested here, we recommend use of OPC with ff19SB.},

Yet, despite several decades of intense research, these models are still far from perfect. Presented here is an alternative approach to constructing widely used point charge water models. In contrast to the conventional approach, we do not impose any geometry constraints on the model other than the symmetry. Instead, we optimize the distribution of point charges to best describe the “electrostatics” of the water molecule. The resulting “optimal” 3-charge, 4-point rigid water model (OPC) reproduces a comprehensive set of bulk properties significantly more accurately than commonly used rigid models: average error relative to experiment is 0.76\%. Close agreement with experiment holds over a wide range of temperatures. The improvements in the proposed model extend beyond bulk properties: compared to common rigid models, predicted hydration free energies of small molecules using OPC are uniformly closer to experiment, with root-mean-square error {\textbackslash}textless1 kcal/mol.},

	abstract = {We describe here a general Amber force field (GAFF) for organic molecules. GAFF is designed to be compatible with existing Amber force fields for proteins and nucleic acids, and has parameters for most organic and pharmaceutical molecules that are composed of H, C, N, O, S, P, and halogens. It uses a simple functional form and a limited number of atom types, but incorporates both empirical and heuristic models to estimate force constants and partial atomic charges. The performance of GAFF in test cases is encouraging. In test I, 74 crystallographic structures were compared to GAFF minimized structures, with a root-mean-square displacement of 0.26 Å, which is comparable to that of the Tripos 5.2 force field (0.25 Å) and better than those of MMFF 94 and CHARMm (0.47 and 0.44 Å, respectively). In test II, gas phase minimizations were performed on 22 nucleic acid base pairs, and the minimized structures and intermolecular energies were compared to MP2/6-31G* results. The RMS of displacements and relative energies were 0.25 Å and 1.2 kcal/mol, respectively. These data are comparable to results from Parm99/RESP (0.16 Å and 1.18 kcal/mol, respectively), which were parameterized to these base pairs. Test III looked at the relative energies of 71 conformational pairs that were used in development of the Parm99 force field. The RMS error in relative energies (compared to experiment) is about 0.5 kcal/mol. GAFF can be applied to wide range of molecules in an automatic fashion, making it suitable for rational drug design and database searching. © 2004 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

In this work we test the performance of a recently developed generalized Born method, GB\_NSR6 (Aguilar et al. J. Chem. Theory Comput. 2010, 6, 3613–3639) on a common benchmark set of 504 small molecules. The computed solvation energies are compared with those obtained previously by explicit solvent models and experiment. The dominant polar component of the solvation energy is computed by GB\_NSR6 with no adjustable parameters, producing a root mean square deviation (RMSD) of 0.89 kcal/mol with respect to explicit solvent (TIP3P). The relatively small nonpolar contribution is estimated using the Gallicchio et al. (J. Comput. Chem. 2005, 25, 479–499) approach. Our results show that GB\_NSR6 offers a reasonable balance between efficiency and accuracy: the RMSD from the experiment of computed solvation energies is 1.2 kcal/mol, which is essentially the same as the accuracy of the much more computationally expensive explicit solvent treatment. The average computational time needed to compute the total solvation energy per molecule via GB\_NSR6 is only tens of milliseconds on a commodity PC for a typical molecule of about 20 atoms.

	abstract = {The generalized Born model (GB) provides a reasonably accurate and computationally efficient way to compute the electrostatic component (ΔGel) of the solvation free energy. In this work, we have developed a method to compute effective Born radii, which is intended to address the known secondary structure bias of the GB model reported earlier (Roe et al. J. Phys. Chem. B, 2007, 111, 1846−1857). Our analytical approach, termed AR6, is based on the {\textbackslash}textbarr{\textbackslash}textbar−6 (R6) integration over an approximation to molecular volume. Within the approach, several computationally efficient corrections to the pairwise VDW−volume integration are combined to closely approximate the true molecular volume in the vicinity of each atom. The accuracy of the AR6 model in predicting relative ΔGel is tested on four conformational states of alanine decapeptide. Changes in ΔGel estimated by AR6 between various pairs of conformational states have the same RMS error relative to the explicit solvent, as do the corresponding numerical PB values; at the same time, the RMS error of the proposed model is 2 times lower than that of the popular GB\_OBC model from the AMBER package. Tests against the PB treatment on 22 biomolecular structures including proteins and DNA show that the relative error of ΔGel is 0.58\%; the RMS error of ΔGel computed by AR6 is 3 times lower than the corresponding value for GB\_OBC. However, the computational efficiencies of the AR6 and GB\_OBC models are comparable. A variant of the R6 model, NSR6, based on numerically exact integration over triangulated molecular surface is tested on a “challenge” set of small drug-like molecules (Nicholls et al. J. Med. Chem. 2008, 51, 769−779). When augmented with cavity and VDW terms to account for the nonpolar part of solvation energy, the model with only one free parameter is capable of predicting the total solvation free energy to within 1.73 kcal/mol RMS error relative to experimental data. Within the NSR6 formulation, computation of the nonpolar contribution is particularly efficient because its VDW part depends on the same {\textbackslash}textbarr{\textbackslash}textbar−6 integrals.},

	abstract = {We present the first global parameterization and validation of a novel charge model, called AM1-BCC, which quickly and efficiently generates high-quality atomic charges for computer simulations of organic molecules in polar media. The goal of the charge model is to produce atomic charges that emulate the HF/6-31G* electrostatic potential (ESP) of a molecule. Underlying electronic structure features, including formal charge and electron delocalization, are first captured by AM1 population charges; simple additive bond charge corrections (BCCs) are then applied to these AM1 atomic charges to produce the AM1-BCC charges. The parameterization of BCCs was carried out by fitting to the HF/6-31G* ESP of a training set of {\textbackslash}textgreater2700 molecules. Most organic functional groups and their combinations were sampled, as well as an extensive variety of cyclic and fused bicyclic heteroaryl systems. The resulting BCC parameters allow the AM1-BCC charging scheme to handle virtually all types of organic compounds listed in The Merck Index and the NCI Database. Validation of the model was done through comparisons of hydrogen-bonded dimer energies and relative free energies of solvation using AM1-BCC charges in conjunction with the 1994 Cornell et al. forcefield for AMBER.13 Homo- and hetero-dimer hydrogen-bond energies of a diverse set of organic molecules were reproduced to within 0.95 kcal/mol RMS deviation from the ab initio values, and for DNA dimers the energies were within 0.9 kcal/mol RMS deviation from ab initio values. The calculated relative free energies of solvation for a diverse set of monofunctional isosteres were reproduced to within 0.69 kcal/mol of experiment. In all these validation tests, AMBER with the AM1-BCC charge model maintained a correlation coefficient above 0.96. Thus, the parameters presented here for use with the AM1-BCC method present a fast, accurate, and robust alternative to HF/6-31G* ESP-fit charges for general use with the AMBER force field in computer simulations involving organic small molecules. © 2002 Wiley Periodicals, Inc.

Although it has been a challenge to develop small molecules that are capable of occluding the large, often relatively featureless protein–protein interaction interface, there are increasing numbers of examples of small molecules that function in this manner with reasonable potency. This article will highlight the current progress in the development of small molecule protein–protein interaction inhibitors that have applications in the treatment or study of central nervous system function and disease.

Designing a small molecule to bind to a protein–protein interface and subsequently inhibit the interaction poses several challenges, including the initial identification of suitable protein–protein interactions, the surface area of the interface (it is often large), and the location of ‘hot spots’ (small regions suitable for drug binding).

	abstract = {Protein–protein interactions (PPIs) are increasingly being targeted by drug discovery groups, and there exists great scope for therapeutic modulation of this target class in disease.The array of structurally interacting elements through which proteins interact with one another is wide and resists clear-cut classification. However, broad divisions can be made by grouping interactions based upon the globular or peptidic nature of the proteins.Some strategies for developing inhibitors against a given PPI may have more traction against certain classes of PPIs than others; for example, fragment-based drug discovery has shown particular promise in targeting bromodomains, as have peptide mimetics in mimicking β-strands.We examine case studies representative of the various structural types of PPI and discuss the lessons learnt from each.A summary of current status of inhibitors in clinical trials against different targets is presented.},

	abstract = {Motivation: Molecular recognition between biological macromolecules and organic small molecules plays an important role in various life processes. Both structural information and binding data of biomolecular complexes are indispensable for depicting the underlying mechanism in such an event. The PDBbind database was created to collect experimentally measured binding data for the biomolecular complexes throughout the Protein Data Bank (PDB). It thus provides the linkage between structural information and energetic properties of biomolecular complexes, which is especially desirable for computational studies or statistical analyses. Results: Since its first public release in 2004, the PDBbind database has been updated on an annual basis. The latest release (version 2013) provides experimental binding affinity data for 10 776 biomolecular complexes in PDB, including 8302 protein–ligand complexes and 2474 other types of complexes. In this article, we will describe the current methods used for compiling PDBbind and the updated status of this database. We will also review some typical applications of PDBbind published in the scientific literature. Availability and implementation: All contents of this database are freely accessible at the PDBbind-CN Web server at http://www.pdbbind-cn.org/ . Contact: wangrx@mail.sioc.ac.cn . Supplementary information: Supplementary data are available at Bioinformatics online.},

	abstract = {Protein–protein complex structures have been predicted for CAPRI Rounds 3 and 5 using a reduced protein model. Proteins are represented by up to 3 pseudoatoms per amino acid. The docking approach termed ATTRACT is based on energy minimization in translational and rotational degrees of freedom of one protein with respect to another protein. The reduced protein model allows one to perform systematic docking minimization of many thousand start structures in reasonable computer time. Flexibility of critical surface side-chains can be accounted for by a multiple conformational copy approach. The multicopy approach allows simultaneous adjustment of side-chain conformations and optimization of translational and rotational degrees of freedom of one protein with respect to the partner during docking. For 3 (Targets 8, 14, and 19) out of 5 CAPRI targets, the approach resulted in predictions in close agreement with experiment [root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) of backbone atoms within 10 Å of the protein–protein interface {\textbackslash}textless 1.8 Å]. The comparison of predicted and experimental structures of the CAPRI targets indicates that besides local conformational changes (e.g., changes in side-chain conformations), global conformational changes of the protein backbone can be critical for complex formation. These conformational changes not accounted for during docking are a likely reason for the unrealistic predictions in 2 cases (Targets 9 and 18). Proteins 2005;60:252–256. © 2005 Wiley-Liss, Inc.},

We present here an automatic algorithm of perceiving atom types that are defined in a description table, and an automatic algorithm of assigning bond types just based on atomic connectivity. The algorithms have been implemented in a new module of the AMBER packages. This auxiliary module, antechamber (roughly meaning “before AMBER”), can be applied to generate necessary inputs of leap—the AMBER program to generate topologies for minimization, molecular dynamics, etc., for most organic molecules. The algorithms behind the manipulations may be useful for other molecular mechanical packages as well as applications that need to designate atom types and bond types.},
